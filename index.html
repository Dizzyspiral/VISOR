This is a long sentence a really long sentence so long with no commas or anything man it really should end, don't you think, oh there was a comma phew we needed that but still really this is too long.</textarea> -->
                <textarea id="user_text" rows=60 cols=80>VISOR may not look like much, but it's a handy editing tool! VISOR helps you spot common writing faux pas, such as overuse of adverbs, repeated words, and long sentences. For example, this lovely adverb will be highlighted to make it stand out to you. If I use the word "boy" and then use "boy" again, it will highlight the second occurrence. This is to let you that maybe you want to use a different word. Finally, long sentences, like this one, are cumbersome to read and so VISOR will let you know that you should do your readers a favor and trim it down just a tad so they don't get bored. Ready to try it out? Just press the "analyze" button to begin! Then try copying your own text into this window to see what VISOR finds for you.</textarea>
